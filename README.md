SNAKE is a single player game with no resolute end. The “Game Over” screen will appear when the snake runs into the wall not when the snake runs over itself. The objective is to eat as many “apples” as possible without “dying.” You start with a single black box for your snake which will grow one block with every apple you eat  - the green block is your apple.
